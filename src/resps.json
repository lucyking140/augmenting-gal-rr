        "subheading": "Reading: Man-Computer Symbiosis, J. C. R. Licklider, IRE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics, volume HFE-1, 1960.",
        "text": "<h3>Man Computer Symbiosis</h3> <p> Licklider refers to himself as an optimist repeatedly in the piece, highlighted by his aspirational hopes for the pace of technical development and his generally positive outlook on the relationship between computers and humanity. He links the development of artificial intelligence (referring to the traditional idea of AI as technology that simulates human learning to independently come to conclusions) with the 'most creative and exciting” period in the “history of mankind.” His choice to first mention creativity – not efficiency, as we might today – highlights his perception of the computer as a tool to enable higher brain use, further exemplified by his seemingly implicit assumption that the human operator is always ultimately in control. Today, discourse seems to focus more on the moments where human operators lose control, such as with content algorithms that are percieved as almost manipulating the viewers they serve. Licklider’s use of the term “Man Computer Symbiosis” might also be representative of this pattern – the field of “Human Computer Interaction” seems to be a general modern evolution of this concept, but we lose the positive connotation of “symbiosis” in the modern reimagining. </p> <p> I’m looking forward to learning more about the relationship of creativity and generative AI from the artist’s perspective in this class – it’s been interesting to watch the aggressive <a style={{ padding: 0 }} href='https://news.sky.com/story/the-brutalist-director-defends-use-of-ai-to-refine-his-lead-stars-performances-13293656' target='_blank' >backlash</a> to any use of “AI” in creative fields when to me, it doesn’t seem much different from other forms of processing that we’ve largely accepted in the art world (some of which already use some sort of ML modeling). I’m curious to learn more about what those more familiar with creative industries think of the role of generative AI in future creative development, and if it will cause significant detriment to artistic fields or if it might introduce challenging but not necessarily disastrous changes, such as the transition to streaming services for the music recording industry. </p> <h3>Efficiency</h3> <p> Licklider also suggests that the technical capacity for efficiency is the main enabler of conventional computer usage – this reminds me of the importance of the development of increasingly efficient processing chips in the recent surge in LLM innovation, where physical processing constraints were a significant hindrance along with developing intellectual understanding of the algorithms' mechanisms. I think we spoke about this in class, but one problem with this most recent spike in chip efficiency is our perpetual urge to fill newly freed resources to increase our capabilities even further. Although increased chip efficiency has the potential to decrease some of the environmental impacts of training these LLMs, it seems unlikely that any company will do anything but fill the new resources with even larger models. </p> <h3>Communication</h3> <p> Licklider’s complete dismissal of the possibility of typing becoming the dominant method of communication with computers – to the extent that he dedicates a significant portion of the end of his paper to exploring automatic speech recognition as an alternative – was a significant departure from his otherwise almost prophetic vision of modern computer use. He suggests not only that businesspeople will not be willing to learn to type, but also that computer operators themselves will find it easier to hand-write information (given, including diagrams, etc. that can’t be typed). It’s not entirely clear to me why he thinks it would be easier for the operator to learn to “write or print in a manner legible to the machine” than to learn to type, though. It seems to me that both typing and printing would require the same layer of automation to translate plaintext into code, with only print introducing the second challenge of handwriting recognition. His lack of clarity here despite his expert knowledge is a good reminder of the ever-present possibility that our current day predictions for technological development are also wildly incorrect. </p>",

        "subheading": "Reading: Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman, Paul Du Gay and Stuart Hall, The Open University, 1997.",
        "text": "<p> Du Gay's discussion of the importance of cultural background when understanding products like the Walkman highlights the iterative development of society, as we default to comparisons with the familiar when faced with something new. This reminded me of <a style={ padding: 0 } href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOEqzt36JEM' target='_blank' >this conversation</a >, which underscores the importance of cultural context in communication by asking the question of how to communicate danger thousands of years in the future. Stripping the context of language, symbols, and shared experiences that define not only regional societies but humanity at large introduces incredible challenges to communicating even vague ideas, highlighting Du Gay's point that society itself is defined by and equivalent to culture. Similarly, practices like constructing intentional time capsules force us to contend with how to capture our modern life in a universal language. </p> <p> NASA's <a style= {{ padding: 0 }} href='https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/voyager-golden-record-overview/' target='_blank' > Golden Record</a > attempts to do so in a way that relates directly to the Walkman – by sharing a phonograph record, NASA chose music and sound as the universal language of society at large (earthly human or otherwise). This example may have been motivated by physical conditions – ink printed on paper, other forms of visual media, or modern sound recordings wouldn't necessarily survive the conditions or length of its journey in space – but the idea that it's possible to share the essence of our culture through sound relates directly to the social shifts in music listening introduced by the Walkman. With it, listening to music became an individual activity, but we've maintained a communal connection to it through other forms of connection like social media. Streaming services like Spotify also ease the process of exploring new music, bridging previously distinct communities but also reducing the potency of subcultures that previously differentiated themselves with music. </p> <p> In reference to Walter Benjamin, Du Gay introduces the question of reproduction in art through the context of the transition from live performance to recorded music, specifically referring to Benjamin's claim that mechanical reproduction “affects the uniqueness and ‘authenticity’ of the work of art. From the opposite perspective, it seems to me that mass reproduction of many art forms – visual arts, video recordings of films and plays, and recorded music – also has the potentially positive effect of introducing an art piece more ubiquitously into the cultural zeitgeist, perhaps maximizing the cultural and emotional impact that many artists aim to inspire. The idea that uniqueness itself correlates with authenticity might relate to the general association between scarcity and value – although there are additional visual and contextual features in viewing a physical work of art, it seems that even viewing a reproduction would communicate the same artistic message. It seems to me that this prioritization of authenticity preserves a sense of novelty in art, but doesn't necessarily deepen a viewer's emotional connection to it. From the artists’ perspective, however, maintaining a sense of control over one's work seems integral in implementation, in order to keep control over the proliferation and profit from a piece. Perhaps both this need for monetary control and the consumer's desire for scarcity originate with the modern commodification of the art world. </p>",

        "subheading": "Reading: A Cultural Approach to Interaction Design, Janet Murray, MIT Press, 2011.",
        "text": "<p> I found Murray's emphasis on the expansion of the idea of the interface very interesting – portraying software design as something that interacts with the backend functionality and a user's intentions, as well as the traditional visual screen interface, introduces additional factors outside of aesthetics alone. For example, this expanded context of “interaction design” might better encompass and prioritize potential access issues for blind or deaf users, thus improving a platform's ability to communicate to its user base. It also potentially creates an opportunity for expanding the realm of the interface – Apple's new eye tracking software that allows users to navigate with eye motions instead of a traditional touch screen, for example, introduces a new interface component through the use of the eyes. This has direct benefits for users who don't have the hand dexterity to interact with a handheld device, and perhaps also introduces new opportunities for designing platforms specifically with this tool in mind. </p> <p> I also found Murray's differentiation between information and content to be very illuminating. Our typical perception of art as something created with a certain media (e.g. text-based writing, physical paintings, etc.) fails to consider the platform it was intended to cater to – was a painting made on commission to flatter a customer or was a video made for a theater or for an app like TikTok. This idea of directly considering the publication context helps to explain the specific artifacts that appear based on the technical functionality and audience of the platform. </p>",

        "text": "<p>Drucker's reference to the critical reception to a digital Van Gogh display, suggesting that critics found the unique presentation of information used on the site to be especially insightful in presenting the art, highlights the role of medium in the portrayal of content that Murray also discussed in last week's readings. In this case, the methodologies of data visualization offered a new perspective on art that is already incredibly frequently evaluated and studied, suggesting that perspective (and the unique diversity of presentation opportunities in the digital realm) can provide new insights and shift our understanding of physical objects, as well as the other way around. </p><p>Drucker also focuses on the idea of an interface as holistic, including sound and haptics as well as visuals. They specifically mention the early example of the flight cabin, which is an interface with a direct proxy to the physical environment, and the major challenge of presenting a massive amount of information in a quickly understandable way. Drucker's reference to this environment and its role in shaping interface design reminded me of the design that goes into shaping alarm sounds, especially in environments like an airplane cockpit where many alarms may go off at once and pilots can easily develop alarm fatigue. Like in the cockpit, there are many haptic and audio aspects of an interface that we don't necessarily notice in our daily lives  – cell phone vibrations, for instance, are used in Duolingo and other gaming apps to convey additional subtle cues along with visual features. Drucker's inclusion of these dimensions brings attention to aspects of the interface beyond the visual, expanding on the idea that “interfaces, increasingly, will be the experience of being in the world” (219). The inclusion of sound and other non-visual stimuli in the conversation presents a very different idea of a digital landscape than one that is visual alone. </p>",

        "subheading": "Hypertext as Subversive?, David Kolb, 1997.",
        "text": "<p> Kolb's text highlights the way digital media transforms the directionality of our trains of thought. The graph of hyperlinks formed by his essay reminded me most directly of a news article containing many links to sources, which illustrated my own habit of avoiding or subconsciously ignoring those links out of an effort to maintain a linear thought process (kind of the opposite of Kolb's idea of “seductive links”). In these segments and in the context of the article, my brain almost skips over the additional opportunities for stimuli in an effort to not ‘lose’ my current mental spot on the page. In the context of news articles, I sometimes find myself assigning credibility simply to the appearance of the links and the external sources they represent, without taking the time to actually investigate their content. </p> <p> This also isn't necessarily an experience unique to digital media and reminded me most directly of footnotes in a book (which themselves are even occasionally self-referential, pointing the reader to other pages or notes in a graph-like structure, albeit to a lesser extent). My various attempts to organize my reading of Kolb's project also mirror the contrast between footnotes and endnotes – I alternate between opening every link as they come up, like a footnote, and completing an article before reading all of the additional links at once like an endnote. This also approximates the difference between depth-first and breadth-first searching in graph algorithms, which brought to my attention the additional challenge of unique identification that Kolb intentionally obscures. To effectively track my own mental path (as well as to track nodes in these algorithms), I need to be able to uniquely identify which pages I've already read. Repeating titles and paraphrased content obscure a sense of seen and unseen information, leaving me with a lack of a sense of linear direction that also makes it challenging to identify a beginning and an end. This idea of perpetual continuity relates to our modern experience of social media, which has a similarly infinite timeline. </p> <p> Also similar to social media is the challenge of returning to information you've previously seen, especially without a unique identifier like a title to allow you to search (although browser search does make this easier – perhaps this was less the case when the project was initially published? The existence of this alternative search path does reduce the experience of the maze/graph a bit), representing Kolb's idea of “throw-away consumables” – our modern algorithms make it easy to be presented automatically with relevant information, but often reduce our ability to intentionally seek specific content via text search. </p> <p> The sense that more information or entertainment is perpetually at your fingertips – and that this might be your only chance to see it – also draws you in for just one more link or one more post. I'm pretty sure I left some pages unread, but when I went back to look for them, I couldn't find them. This experience of incompleteness reminded me of Kolb's reference to Le Guin's idea that if all information was kept and linked together, the connections would lose meaning entirely (similar to the relative lack of interesting algorithmic behaviors of a complete graph). </p>",

        "text": "<p>Kay and Goldberg contextualize their introduction to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook' target='_blank'>Dynabook</a> through the idea of perpetual learning, building from our <a href='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/anti-mac-interface/' target='_blank'>previous discussions</a> of generational differences in computer knowledge and the necessity of learning instead of innate knowledge in interface design. Writing at the very beginning of the computer era, aspects of computing like the use of a mouse as a pointer or the idea of a window with buttons need to be explicitly explained. The relative simplicity of the system shown here compared to our modern maze of symbolism highlights just how hard it can be to adapt to a new interface – I recently taught my <a href='https://www.ageuk.org.uk/latest-press/articles/2024/more-than-1-in-3-over-65s-4.7-million-lack-the-basic-skills-to-use-the-internet-successfully/' target='_blank'>grandparents</a> how to use Google search, and it was challenging to even comprehend the details I unconsciously overlooked in order to explain how they worked. Even the idea of needing to formally train children to use computers is no longer true today – they've become so integrated into our everyday life that understanding at least basic interfaces is adopted similarly to learning to speak.</p><p>The Xerox team's choice to work first with children also positions the Dynabook as a tool for learning, while also perhaps leveraging children's unique ability to gain skills and grasp unfamiliar concepts. Kay and Goldman repeatedly highlight the age of the children who design the tools they describe, emphasizing the ease with which even a teenager can work in their 'Smalltalk' system. This emphasis on learning extends to their predictions for the future of the device, as the authors predict that all Dynabook users will independently design and implement their own tools. Their choice to offload the system design process to the user seems to especially contrast with the modern trend to abstract as much functionality as possible from the user, for instance through the use of context and recommendations that we’ve discussed in previous sessions. Today’s digital world also appears to expect less programmatic knowledge from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)' target='_blank'>children</a>. </p><p>The team's choice to focus the device on creation, both through visual design and audio production, also positions early computers as creative tools as opposed to those for communication or other uses. It's especially interesting in the authors’ forward-looking perspective – they see a future not of networking and intercomputer linkages, but of creation. Interestingly, the physical design of the Dynabook retains so many of the principles of a physical books that it is most similar to today’s (or 2013-ish’s) <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/153jgtu/anyone_have_kindle_with_the_keyboard_built_in/' target='_blank'>e-readers </a>. Perhaps this also fits with the idea that a user will creatively design their own tools, in addition to their actual product. If anything, the focus in this paper is not yet communication between users but instead communication between the computer and the user. Even the name of their programming language, ‘Smalltalk,’ literally appeals to the idea of conversing with the computer. The sense of casualness associated with the idea of small talk also further highlights the team’s intentions to pitch this new creative medium as easy, casual, and intuitive.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Benjamin's discussion of the effect of film and reproduction on the experience of human thought through his quote of Duhamel lamenting that his “thoughts have been replaced by human images” also extends directly to hooks’ discussion of the externalization of self in photography. hooks notes that as a child, she could only ‘see an image [she] can love’ in photos of herself, notably distinct from her inability to generate the same feelings toward the more literal idea of herself. This sense that images portray an essence other than or different from the objects they display introduces a layer of complexity to the idea of reproduction at all, perhaps connecting Benjamin's idea of the spectator versus the actor, with the spectator relating first to the camera, not the actor themselves, in the context of recorded film. In hooks’ case, the spectator is also the actor, but this layer of abstraction remains. Her idea of ‘proof’ of existence stored within a physical photograph, both in her case and in her description of her friend’s mission to reconnect with a previous version of himself through images, also highlights the lack of temporality of a photo, fitting with Benjamin's idea of the historical and temporal context and ritual of a painting.</p><p>hooks also introduces the importance of control over the reproduction of an image or art piece, highlighting the unequal representation of black people in white galleries and the complete lack of images of black people captured by black photographers in white spaces. Building on her discussion of the role of images in identity, this separation between the pictured and the photographer gives the white photographer an opportunity to exert control over the self-conception of the black people they photograph, which hooks and her family circumvent through their representations of themselves. This idea of who possesses the ability to reproduce not only reinforces power dynamics like this case but also might eliminate the context of the possessor and creator's intentions when one cannot control who gains access to an image through reproduction, like the case of the snapshot of hooks’ father. As she notes, her sister's access to the image is a physical representation of their close relationship, which is diluted by the sister’s ability to share the image freely with her other siblings. Simultaneously, the method of how one acquires a photograph or reproduction provides new context (e.g. a reminder that hooks had to access such an image through her sister) while also erasing the original context of to whom the original work was given.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Miller introduces a contrast between ordering things and being ordered by things, with the former representing the historical drive to categorize objects and rigorously evaluate their differences while the latter results in objects shaping their users through their design and functionality. In the later category, Miller specifically mentions the role of gendered design in shifting towards more ‘feminine’ constructions that hide the mechanical components of objects that previously catered to men.</p><p>This also reminded me of the question of who controls the objects that order their users – for example, Gillette’s intentional shift toward selling razors to women in an attempt to increase the company's shaving customer base, in turn creating new cultural standards of hairlessness for women. Perhaps this also fits with Miller's idea of the visibility of mechanical components, as razors shift from raw, almost violent sharp objects to today's design that leaves the actual sharp component barely visible.</p><p>The idea of objects as temporal and context-dependent also arises throughout Miller's text, for example through the example of the significance of snow to Inuits who work with the icy environment as a food source in comparison to urban children who see it as a tool of play (perhaps even further in the opposite direction, to urban adults who often see it as an obstacle to overcome in order to go back to strict regiments of work and movement). </p><p>Miller's reference to Strathern's study of Melanesian ideas that objects are defined in relation what they can transform into also connects to the idea we've discussed previously that humans seek to identify new ideas in terms of what is familiar, highlighting the connectivity between physical objects and cultural connotations as a network instead of a linear path or set of distinct items. More generally, this also relates to Miller's notes on the historical archeological practice of ascribing complex cultural associations based on physical objects alone. As Miller describes, when one applies these own methods to present-day practices, it becomes more obvious that certain practices cannot be understood by studying individual objects alone.<p>",

Shchetvina also introduces the idea of “potential evocative objects” – autobiographical items made without an idea of identity but, when faced with their loss, suddenly take on a feeling of importance. They describe these items as especially prevalent in the digital era, where a low barrier to communication and media production allows users to create artifacts without thought to their specific design or representation.</p><p>As someone who collects small, mundane physical objects (tickets, pamphlets, keys, etc.) as mementos of important life events, this of a lower barrier to entry also highlighted the ease of storage in a digital world, in which these artifacts are easy to accumulate without noticing, unlike physical objects that occupy space. I might be much more likely to toss a slip of paper than delete a digital message, knowing that if I don't I'll have to maintain and store the former while the latter exists without interference.</p><p>When reading Shchetvina’s paper I noticed that I do the same with alarms I set in the IOS clock app, which allows for a short description to be added to a timed alarm. I write these hastily for the purpose of a very short-term reminder, but I find myself creating new alarms instead of changing those that already exist with messages that elicit a specific (even if mundane) memory. Now, I have alarm messages from over five years ago that feel like a uniquely realistic reminder of past events, and a reminder that the alarms I set now might contribute to these memories in the future.</p><p>For those like Shchetvina's interviewees who are forced to delete these artifacts, Shchetvina introduces the questions of how to handle information separated from its interface. Specifically, they describe the fact that information tends to lose its emotional significance when removed from its networked context, highlighting the relationship between autobiography and the external social world. Without interaction with others, either through viewing or commenting, these memories lose their associations with our identities.</p> <p>The importance of the interface also relates to Shchetvina's other example of the many hidden players controlling our access to archives, such as the loss of access to Mastercard in Russia leading to one of their interviewee's losing their ability to pay for and thus access their archive. It's easy outside of a context of surveillance like those of Shchetvina's interviewees to forget that social media, which can feel like a uniquely accessible form of speech in comparison to institutionalized media, is ultimately controlled by a largely unregulated. Shchetvina's emphasis on the loss of archives as a key moment in defining what one perceives as autobiographical also reminds me of recent moments where this facade of openness has been violated, such as recent actions from social media companies to remove posts from student protest groups and some companies' quick commitment to Trumpian ideas of media and free speech.</p>",

In many of these fields, students are prepared as if they were to pursue a career or further study in the field, often providing ample opportunities for creation that mirror (to a certain extent) what one does when actively contributing to that field as a scholar -- writing analytical essays that go beyond summary, for example, or participating in the experimental process and activities like science fairs. Math, however, is taught more so with the assumption that students will use those skills but not contribute to the field as creators beyond their role as implementers of existing algorithms and rules. This also ties into the portrayal of mathematical fields as fixed and complete. Papert and Harel's emphasis on math as a creative process seems to align more with what mathematicians do, which perhaps could present math as a more accessible field for future study for students who are exposed to the possibility of creating or analyzing mathematical information earlier on.</p><p>When I was first asked to present an analytical mathematic paper my first year of college, I suddenly experienced this sense of control myself -- being given the opportunity to reverse the traditional learning process by following a path of connections between theorems as I found them referenced in others reminded me much more of the process of writing a historical research paper, which drew pure math outside of the realm of impossibility and closer to something like philosophy (which is usually already close to many mathematical concepts). This sense of autonomy is missing in many instructionist math education settings, and is perhaps key to opening the field to a broader range of contributors.</p><p>In addition to research, Papert and Harel’s reference to the relationship between math and art reminded me of computation’s roots in weaving, which is often seen as a creative and domestic activity but contributed directly to our modern conception of the computer. <a href='https://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2024/woven-histories-textiles-modern-abstraction.html' target='_blank'>This exhibit</a>has some incredibly interesting examples of the use of mathematical functions to generate beautiful (and, as the child Papert and Harel mention describes, 'grace') images.

This reminded me of the broader challenge of designing programming languages – I think it’s hard for me to imagine an escape from the spectrum between the inconvenience but complete independence of a low-level language and the ease but limited capacities of a higher-level one.</p><p>Achieving a medium like what Victor describes to enable us to work in a sketch-like capacity when building dynamic models seems like it would require near-complete independence with the speed and ease of pre-made functionalities, suggesting that we’d have to come up with a methodology completely outside this spectrum. I found this exercise of imagining mediums completely distinct from our current systems of speech, writing, programming, etc. especially interesting yet also very challenging.</p><p>It seems especially important to intentionally hash out this conversation in light of Victor’s other point that humane technology won’t simply arise from our current laissez-faire system of hands-off innovations. It seems like the singular system of honing in on a specific model of creation that Victor describes excludes both inventions and ideas that could only be facilitated by a more comprehensive system as he describes, but also entire individuals who struggle to process information in the way that has been enforced as universal, leading to an additional hierarchy that would be avoided in Victor’s imagined world of dynamic modeling.</p>  ",

        "text": "<p>Soulelis's emphasis on the translation between the digital and print worlds highlights the idea of scarcity and authenticity that we discussed earlier in the semester, which was reinforced by his discussion of the purpose of high-end photo books. No longer are printed mediums, especially those like the photo books that display relatively little information (e.g. one photo per page) that is not made to be referenced continuously, sources that are acquired for the sake of gaining information. Instead, they serve a purpose of communicating something about their owner, more like a commodity than a piece of information.</p><p>The fancy bindings and expensive price of the photobooks coupled with producer strategies like limited and special editions make them a scarce resource that indicates the status of their owner, which is strengthened by the display purposes of such books. Unlike a digital medium, which we view individually without anyone perceiving it, the physical book is an indicator to others that the book's owner consumes and is aware of such information. Soulelis' project, which directly refers back to the inherent lack of scarcity in publicly-available digital content, bridges this new use of print media with the original idea of print as the most accessible method of mass communication.</p><p>In addition to the shifting perception of the acquisition and ownership of physical media, Soulelis introduces an idea that databases and APIs allow us to reframe the idea of an archive from something composed of individual pieces to something that means more in the aggregate than anything individual. The 'Other Peoples' Images' project that Soulelis describes, for example, appeals to an aggregate idea about society as a whole while stripping any original context from the individual pieces in the piece.</p>",
